## 📋 Executive Summary

This project develops a **production-ready machine learning system** to predict driver attrition for Ola, India's largest ride-sharing platform. The solution predicts driver churn probability with **95.23% ROC-AUC accuracy**, enabling data-driven retention strategies and reducing costly driver acquisition cycles. The model identifies at-risk drivers before departure, supporting targeted intervention programs worth millions in saved acquisition costs.

**Key Achievements:**
- Built ensemble ML model with **95.23% ROC-AUC** and **90.78% accuracy**
- Identified **tenure and performance ratings** as strongest churn predictors (57.6% combined importance)
- Discovered **₹11,995 income differential** between churned and retained drivers
- Reduced false negatives to **6%** for early intervention capability
- Processed **19,104 monthly records** from **2,381 unique drivers** across 24-month period

## 🎯 Business Problem

**Ola's Critical Challenge:**

Recruiting and retaining drivers represents one of the most significant operational challenges in ride-sharing platforms. With high driver churn rates, Ola faces compounding problems: costly recruitment cycles, platform inconsistency, and competitive disadvantage against Uber. When drivers leave unexpectedly, customer experience suffers, and acquiring replacement drivers is substantially more expensive than retaining existing ones.

### **The Specific Issues:**

- **High Attrition Rate:** 67.87% of drivers left the platform during the 24-month observation period
- **Acquisition Cost Burden:** New driver recruitment is 5-10x more expensive than retention initiatives
- **Lost Institutional Knowledge:** Each departure represents lost market experience and customer relationships
- **Unpredictable Supply:** Sudden departures create service gaps and operational chaos
- **Reactive Management:** No early warning system to identify and support at-risk drivers

### **Business Opportunity:**

Implement a **predictive attrition prevention system** that:
- Flags high-risk drivers before departure for proactive intervention
- Prioritizes limited HR resources on drivers most likely to leave
- Enables data-driven retention strategies based on actual churn patterns
- Supports targeted incentive programs for high-value at-risk drivers
- Provides economic justification for retention investments

**Impact Potential:** A 10% improvement in retention could save ₹50+ lakhs annually in recruitment costs alone.

- Monitor prediction accuracy drift over time
- Update feature engineering pipeline as driver behaviors evolve

### **Ethical Considerations:**
- Ensure retention interventions don't discriminate by protected attributes
- Maintain driver privacy; use aggregated insights rather than individual tracking
- Offer transparent communication about performance metrics to drivers
- Use predictions to support, not punish drivers
