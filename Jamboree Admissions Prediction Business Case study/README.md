## üéØ Business Problem

**Jamboree Education** has successfully helped thousands of students achieve top scores in GMAT, GRE, and SAT through their unique teaching methodologies. However, they faced a critical challenge:

### **The Challenge:**
- Students needed **personalized guidance** on admission probability before investing in expensive application processes
- Counselors required **data-driven insights** to provide accurate advice beyond just test scores
- **Competitive pressure** from other education consultancies offering similar prediction services
- Need for **scalable solution** to handle growing student inquiries efficiently

### **Business Opportunity:**
Jamboree launched a **"Graduate Admission Probability Feature"** on their website where students can input their academic profile and instantly receive admission chance predictions for Ivy League and top global universities.

**Mission:** Build the intelligent, data-driven backbone that powers this feature using advanced machine learning and statistical analysis.
